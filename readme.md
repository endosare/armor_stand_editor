# Armor Stand Editor
Armor Stand Editor is a tool that helps to change the pose of Armor Stand in an intuitive way.  
*Note: this datapack does sacrifice a bit of freedom to archive this; you won't be able to modify any z-axis rotation in this datapack. I recommend you install some other armor stand editor alongside this as well.

# How to install
Installing datapack is the same on both singleplayer and server.
1) Download the datapack ([Armor Stand Editor](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/armor-stand-editor/))
2) Navigate to the world folder
3) Open `/datapacks/` folder (if it doesn't exist you can create it yourself)
4) Put this datapack inside. (You don't have to unzip anything just place it there)
5) Run command `/reload` (If you're running a bukkit/spigot/paper server you need to run `/minecraft:reload` or it might cause some glitch in your server)
6) If the datapack is installed correctly you'll see this in the advancement tab.
